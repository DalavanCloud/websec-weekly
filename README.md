This repo contains the databases, API's and managers behind https://websecweekly.org. With the code in this repo, I believe that everyone can have access to the content and data which makes up all of the newsletters on Websec Weekly.

At the moment, there are two main managers which distribute the information collected from the API's:

1. A weekly newsletter generated and then sent to your email

2. HipChat notifications which are sent to HipChat @ 9AM and 9PM of every day (for the more hardcore enthusiasts).
